各位币圈的前辈，这是一封乞讨求助的信件，希望您花几分钟阅读。

本人是一个技术人员，有一个技术公司，主要从事网站、手机APP、物联网、区块链软件开发，在2019年疫情前团队规模已达到60人，后来因为疫情影响没有业务，舍不得丢掉公司和团队，撑到现在已经负债累累，没有钱，自然也留不住团队，最后人财两空。

我不会编造故事，能发行代币，但是写不出各种高大上的白皮书募集资金，只能实话实说：我向币圈各位大哥求助，对我进行捐助。

我向诸位承诺，如果我能东山再起，您就是一次投资，根据转账的钱包地址，必给予厚报，我也不想说大话骗人，如果我解决债务危机后还是创业失败了，财务回报是谈不上的，您的帮助就是一次施舍，我只能给好心人祝福。

下面是我的钱包地址：

另外，如果各位有软件开发需求，希望也能考虑考虑我，+86 15822652686 （电话同微信）活儿肯定到位，给大家做好，做细，做得干干净净，也是帮助我一把。
再次感谢大家花时间看完。




Dear predecessors of the coin circle, this is a letter begging for help. I hope you will spend a few minutes reading it.

I am a technician and have a technology company, mainly engaged in website, mobile app, Internet of things and block chain software development. Before the epidemic in 2019, the team size had reached 60 people. Later, because the epidemic affected no business, I was reluctant to lose the company and team. Up to now, I have been heavily in debt and can't keep the team without money. Finally, people and money are empty.

I can't make up stories and issue tokens, but I can't write all kinds of tall white papers to raise funds. I can only tell the truth: I ask the big brothers in the coin circle for help and donate to me.

I promise you that if I can make a comeback, you will be an investment. According to the wallet address of the transfer, I will give a thick report. I don't want to lie. If I still fail to start a business after I solve the debt crisis, there will be no financial return. Your help is a charity, and I can only bless the kind-hearted people.

Here is my wallet address:

In addition, if you have software development needs, I hope you can also consider me, + 86 15822652686 (telephone with wechat) must be in place to do a good job for you, do it carefully and do it cleanly, which is also to help me. Thank you again for your time.
